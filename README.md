## What is X-Browser?
X-Browser mixes the best of both worlds when developing for web: a rich text editor with autocomplete functionality and real time testing.  Upon saving your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript file your code will come to life to  live in a multi browser view. Seeing your site running in major browsers like Chrome and Firefox all at once allows for better testing and compatibility checking. With X-Browser, you wont need to leave your editor to make sure your site is the best it can be!

## Why is X-Browser needed?
So why X-Browser over similar cross-browser testing solutions? Other testing services are separated from your testing environment, requiring you to upload your website each time you would like to see your changes. X-Browser offers a streamlined all-in-one solution for testing your website across different browsers. Developers can edit their code and see the website all in one easy-to-use platform, no need for juggling several different tools!
